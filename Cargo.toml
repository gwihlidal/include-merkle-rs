description = "Functionality for generating a Merkle-tree of a given text file with include references, replacing includes paths with a deterministic versioned identity, and also functionality for flattening include directives into a single file. The primary motivation is compiling shaders for various graphics APIs, but the the functionality can apply to a variety of source code parsing use cases."
